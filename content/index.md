# The SeeClickFix API

This describes the resources that make up the official GitHub API v3. If
you have any problems or requests please contact
[us developers](mailto:dev@seeclickfix.com?subject=APIv2).

For the new API v2, start browsing the resources on the right >>

## Current Version

The SeeClickFix API v2 is currently in beta until summer 2013.  A notice will be given closer to the actual date.

We consider the "beta" API unchangeable.  [File a support issue](http://seeclickfix.com/contact_us) if you have problems.

#### Expected Changes

These changes are _not_ implemented, just planned for the next major API version.
