# Events

This is a read-only API to the GitHub events.  These events power the
various activity streams on the site.

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header.  If no new events have
been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current
rate limit will be untouched.  There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that
specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high
server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.

    $ curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-Poll-Interval: 60
    ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"

    # The quotes around the ETag value are important
    $ curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \
        -H 'If-None-Match: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"'
    HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
    X-Poll-Interval: 60

Events support [pagination](/v3/#pagination),
however the `per_page` option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items.
Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

All Events have the same response format:

<%= headers 200, :pagination => true %>
<%= json(:event) { |h| [h] } %>
