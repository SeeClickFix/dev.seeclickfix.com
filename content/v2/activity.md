title: Activity | GitHub API
---

Serving up the 'social' in Social Codingâ„¢, the Activity APIs provide access to
notifications, subscriptions, and timelines.

## Notifications

Notifications of new comments are delivered to users.  The Notifications API
lets you view these notifications, and mark them as read.

## Starring

Repository Starring is a feature that lets users bookmark repositories.  Stars
are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest.  Stars
have no effect on notifications or the activity feed.

## Watching

Watching a Repository registers the user to receive notifications on new
discussions, as well as events in the user's activity feed.

## Events

This is a read-only API of the events that power the various activity streams
on GitHub.
