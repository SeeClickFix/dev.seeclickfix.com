# Pull Request API

* TOC
{:toc}

The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge
pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the [Issue
Comments API](/v3/issues/comments/).

Pull Requests use [these custom media types](#custom-media-types). You
can read more about the use of media types in the API
[here](/v3/media/).

## Link Relations

Pull Requests have these possible link relations:

`self`
: The API location of this Pull Request.

`html`
: The HTML location of this Pull Request.

`comments`
: The API location of this Pull Request's Issue comments.

`review_comments`
: The API location of this Pull Request's Review comments.

## List pull requests

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls

### Parameters

state
: _Optional_ **string** - `open` or `closed` to filter by state. Default
is `open`.

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:pull) { |h| [h] } %>

## Get a single pull request

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :full_pull %>

Pass the appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.

## Create a pull request

    POST /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls

### Input

title
: _Required_ **string**

body
: _Optional_ **string**

base
: _Required_ **string** - The branch (or git ref) you want your changes pulled into.
This should be an existing branch on the current repository.  You cannot
submit a pull request to one repo that requests a merge to a base of
another repo.

head
: _Required_ **string** - The branch (or git ref) where your changes are implemented.

NOTE: `head` and `base` can be either a sha or a branch name. Typically you
would namespace `head` with a user like this: `username:branch`.

<%= json \
  :title     => "Amazing new feature",
  :body      => "Please pull this in!",
  :head      => "octocat:new-feature",
  :base      => "master"
%>

### Alternative Input

You can also create a Pull Request from an existing Issue by passing an
Issue number instead of `title` and `body`.

issue
: _Required_ **number** - Issue number in this repository to turn into a
Pull Request.

<%= json \
  :issue => "5",
  :head  => "ocotocat:new-feature",
  :base  => "master"
%>

### Response

<%= headers 201, :Location => "https://api.github.com/user/repo/pulls/1" %>
<%= json :pull %>

## Update a pull request

    PATCH /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number

### Input

`open` and `closed`.

  :title     => "new title",

  :state     => "open"
