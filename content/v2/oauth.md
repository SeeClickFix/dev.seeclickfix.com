# OAuth

* TOC
{:toc}

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external apps request authorization to
private details in a user's GitHub account without getting their
password. This is preferred over Basic Authentication because tokens can
be limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by users at any
time.

All developers need to [register their
application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) before getting
started. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique Client ID
and Client Secret. The Client Secret should not be shared.

## Web Application Flow

This is a description of the OAuth flow from 3rd party web sites.

### 1. Redirect users to request GitHub access

    GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize

### Parameters

client\_id
: _Required_ **string** - The client ID you received from GitHub when
you [registered](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

redirect\_uri
: _Optional_ **string** - URL in your app where users will be sent
after authorization. See details below about [redirect
urls](#redirect-urls).

scope
: _Optional_ **string** - Comma separated list of [scopes](#scopes).

state
: _Optional_ **string** - An unguessable random string. It is used to protect
against cross-site request forgery attacks.

### 2. GitHub redirects back to your site

If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site
with a temporary code in a `code` parameter as well as the state you provided in
the previous step in a state parameter. If the states don't match, the request
has been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.

Exchange this for an access token:

    POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token

### Parameters

client\_id
: _Required_ **string** - The client ID you received from GitHub when
you [registered](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

redirect\_uri
: _Optional_ **string**

client\_secret
: _Required_ **string** - The client secret you received from GitHub
when you [registered](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

code
: _Required_ **string** - The code you received as a response to [Step 1](#redirect-users-to-request-github-access).

### Response

By default, the response will take the following form:

    access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&token_type=bearer

You can also receive the content in different formats depending on the Accept
header:

    Accept: application/json
    {"access_token":"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a","token_type":"bearer"}

    Accept: application/xml
    <OAuth>
      <token_type>bearer</token_type>
      <access_token>e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a</access_token>
    </OAuth>

### 3. Use the access token to access the API

The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.

    GET https://api.github.com/user?access_token=...

## Non-Web Application Flow

Use basic authentication to create an OAuth2 token using the [interface
below](/v3/oauth/#create-a-new-authorization).  With this technique, a username
and password need not be stored permanently, and the user can revoke access at
any time.

## Redirect URLs

The `redirect_uri` parameter is optional. If left out, GitHub will
redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth Application
settings. If provided, the redirect URL must match the callback URL's
host.

    CALLBACK: http://example.com

    GOOD: https://example.com
    GOOD: http://example.com/bar
    BAD:  http://example.com:8080
    BAD:  http://oauth.example.com:8080
    BAD:  http://example.org

## Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes _limit_
access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond
that which the user already has.

For the web flow, requested scopes be displayed to the user on the authorize
form.

Check headers to see what OAuth scopes you have, and what the API action
accepts.

    $ curl -H "Authorization: bearer TOKEN" https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
    X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user

`X-OAuth-Scopes` lists the scopes your token has authorized.
`X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes` lists the scopes that the action checks for.

(no scope)
: public read-only access (includes public user profile info, public
repo info, and gists).

user
: Read/write access to profile info only.  Note: this scope includes user:email
and user:follow.

user:email
: Read access to a user's email addresses.

user:follow
: Access to follow or unfollow other users.

public\_repo
: Read/write access to public repos and organizations.

repo
: Read/write access to public and private repos and organizations.

repo:status
: Read/write access to public and private repository commit statuses. This
scope is only necessary to grant other users or services access to private
repository commit statuses without granting access to the code. The `repo` and
`public_repo` scopes already include access to commit status for private and
public repositories respectively.

delete\_repo
: Delete access to adminable repositories.

notifications
: Read access to a user's notifications.  `repo` is accepted too.

gist
: Write access to gists.

NOTE: Your application can request the scopes in the initial redirection. You
can specify multiple scopes by separating them by a comma.

    https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?
      client_id=...&
      scope=user,public_repo

## OAuth Authorizations API

There is an API for users to manage their own tokens.  You can only
access your own tokens, and only through Basic Authentication.

## List your authorizations

    GET /authorizations

### Response

<%= headers 200, :pagination => true %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| [h] } %>

## Get a single authorization

    GET /authorizations/:id

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :oauth_access %>

## Create a new authorization

If you need a small number of tokens, implementing the [web flow](#web-application-flow)
can be cumbersome. Instead, tokens can be created using the Authorizations API using
Basic Authentication. To create tokens for a particular OAuth application, you
must provide its client ID and secret, found on the OAuth application settings
page, linked from your [OAuth applications listing on GitHub][app-listing].

    POST /authorizations

### Input

scopes
: _Optional_ **array** - A list of scopes that this authorization is in.

note
: _Optional_ **string** - A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for.

note_url
: _Optional_ **string** - A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.

client_id
: _Optional_ **String** - The 20 character OAuth app client key for which to create the
token.

client_secret
: _Optional_ **String** - The 40 character OAuth app client secret for which to create the
token.

<%= json :scopes => ["public_repo"], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response

<%= headers 201, :Location => "https://api.github.com/authorizations/1"
%>
<%= json :oauth_access %>

## Update an existing authorization

    PATCH /authorizations/:id

### Input

scopes
: _Optional_ **array** - Replaces the authorization scopes with these.

add_scopes
: _Optional_ **array** - A list of scopes to add to this authorization.

remove_scopes
: _Optional_ **array** - A list of scopes to remove from this
authorization.

note
: _Optional_ **string** - A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for.

note_url
: _Optional_ **string** - A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.

You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.

<%= json :add_scopes => ['repo'], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :oauth_access %>

## Delete an authorization

    DELETE /authorizations/:id

### Response

<%= headers 204 %>
