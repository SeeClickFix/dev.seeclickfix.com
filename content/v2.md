# SeeClickFix API v2 Overview

This describes the resources that make up the official SeeClickFix API v2. If
you have any problems or requests please contact
[support](mailto:dev@seeclickfix.com?subject=APIv2).

SeeClickFix provides an open311 compatible API at [http://seeclickfix.com/open311](http://seeclickfix.com/open311).

{:toc}

## Testing

Testing can be done on the `test.seeclickfix.com` subdomain. This 
subdomain has data replicated from production. SSL (https) is not 
available on test.seeclickfix.com. 


## URL Format

URLs follow the following format

    <%= root_version_url %>/< RESOURCE >

## Data Format

All data is sent and received as JSON.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/info
</pre>

<%= json :info %>

## Responses

All responses will return a single object with three guaranteed attributes: `metadata`, `result`, and `errors`.

The `metadata` attribute can contain metadata for the consumer about the
result, for example pagination information, api limits, or query
information. Metadata can be null.

The `result` attribute contains the result of the action. Each action will return
either a result object or collection, but not one or the other
conditionally. (i.e. if you're listing issues and there's only one
result the result will be an array with one element). If there's an
error with the request the result can be null.

The `errors` attribute will always be an array of human readable server
side errors regarding the request. Not all errors are fatal to the
request, so be sure to check the HTTP response code. Errors may be
translated depending on the given locale. If there are no errors this attribute will be null.


## Parameters

Many API methods take optional parameters. Optional parameters will be identified as optional in the documentation.

For POST requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded':

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i -u username -d '{"scopes":["public_repo"]}' https://api.github.com/authorizations
</pre>


## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by
default unless otherwise noted. You can specify further pages with the
`?page` parameter. You can also set a custom page size up to 100 with
the `?per_page` parameter. If you'd like to read more than 100 items
you'll need to construct and query the pages programatically.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.seeclickfix.com/issues?page=2&per_page=10
</pre>


## Blank Fields

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.


## Time Formats

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ


## Errors


### Client Errors

There are two possible types of client errors:

1. Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.

    <%= headers 400 %>
    
        {
          "metadata": null,
          "result": null,
          "errors": [ 
            { "request": "Unable to parse JSON" }
          ]
        }


2. Sending invalid fields will result in a `422 Unprocessable Entity`
   response.

    <%= headers 422 %>

        {
          "metadata": null,
          "result": null,
          "errors": [ 
            { 
              "message": "Summary missing.",
              "resource": "Issue",
              "field": "summary",
              "code": "missing_field"
            }
          ]
        }


These are the possible validation error codes:

missing
: This means a resource does not exist.

missing\_field
: This means a required field on a resource has not been set.

invalid
: This means the formatting of a field is invalid.  The documentation
for that resource should be able to give you more specific information.

If resources have custom validation errors, they will be documented with the resource.


### Server Errors

All server errors return `500 Server Error`.

<%= headers 500 %>


## HTTP Redirects

API v2 uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. Clients should assume that any request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is *not* an error and clients should follow that redirect. Redirect responses will have a `Location` header field which contains the URI of the resource to which the client should repeat the requests.

<%= headers 301 %>

The URI you used to make the request has been superseded by the one specified in the `Location` header field. This and all future requests to this resource should be directed to the new URI.

<%= headers 302 %>

The request should be repeated verbatim to the URI specified in the `Location` header field but clients should continue to use the original URI for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with the HTTP 1.1 spec.


## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, API v2 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.

HEAD
: Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.

GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources.

PATCH
: Used for updating resources with partial JSON data.  For instance, an
Issue resource has `title` and `body` attributes.  A PATCH request may
accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.  PATCH is a
relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept
POST requests.

PUT
: Used for replacing resources or collections. For PUT requests
with no `body` attribute, be sure to set the `Content-Length` header to zero.

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.


## Hypermedia

All resources may have one or more `*_url` properties linking to other
resources.  These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients
don't need to construct URLs on their own.  It is highly recommended that API
clients use these.  Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for
developers.  All URLs are expected to be proper [RFC 6570][rfc] URI templates.


## User Agent Required

All API requests MUST include a valid User Agent string. Requests with no User Agent
string will be rejected. If you are hitting the API without authentication, we ask that
you add some kind of identification to the UA header value. This is so we can contact
you if there are problems.

## Conditional requests

Most responses return `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers. You can use the values
of these headers to make subsequent requests to those resources using the
`If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers, respectively. If the resource
has not changed, the server will return a `304 Not Modified`. 

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/user
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private, max-age=60
ETag: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"

Vary: Accept, Authorization, Cookie

X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4996

$ curl -i https://api.github.com/user -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT"
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified

$ curl -i https://api.github.com/user -H 'If-None-Match: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified

Status: 304 Not Modified
Vary: Accept, Authorization, Cookie
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4996
</pre>

## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function.  This is typically used when browsers want
to embed GitHub content in web pages by getting around cross domain
issues.  The response includes the same data output as the regular API,
plus the relevant HTTP Header information.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com?callback=foo

foo({
  "meta": {
    "status": 200,
    "X-RateLimit-Limit": "5000",
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining": "4966",
    "Link": [ // pagination headers and other links
      ["https://api.github.com?page=2", {"rel": "next"}]
    ]
  },
  "data": {
    // the data
  }
})
</pre>

You can write a JavaScript handler to process the callback like this:

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript">function foo(response) {
  var meta = response.meta
  var data = response.data
  console.log(meta)
  console.log(data)
}</code></pre>

All of the headers are the same String value as the HTTP Headers with one
notable exception: Link.  Link headers are pre-parsed for you and come
through as an array of `[url, options]` tuples.

A link that looks like this:

    Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

... will look like this in the Callback output:

<%= json "Link" => [
  ["url1", {:rel => "next"}],
  ["url2", {:rel => "foo", :bar => "baz"}]] %>


## Geography

At various endpoints SeeClickFix recognizes geography either by a `point` or `area` attribute.

`point` attributes can be submitted in one of two forms:

1. `ll=:latitude|:longitude`
1. `address=:address`

`area` attributes can be submitted in the following forms:

1. `pointzoom=:latitude,:longitude,:zoom`
1. `addresszoom=:address,:zoom`
1. `place_url=:url_name`
1. `bounds=:sw_lat,:sw_lng,:ne_lat,:ne_lng`
1. `watch_area_token=:watch_area_token`

## Locales

All attributes are consistent between locales. Errors may be translated based on the given locale. Objects created will record the locale they were created in and notices based on these objects will be delivered with the proper locale. i.e. if an issue is created with the "es" locale, all email to the creator will be delivered with Spanish translations.
