# SeeClickFix API v2 Overview

This describes the resources that make up the official SeeClickFix API v2. If
you have any problems or requests please contact
[support](mailto:dev@seeclickfix.com?subject=APIv2).

SeeClickFix provides an open311 compatible API at [http://seeclickfix.com/open311](http://seeclickfix.com/open311).

## Coordinate System

All coordinates are assumed to be WSG84. Geographic objects are represented as [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org).

## Testing

Testing can be done on the `test.seeclickfix.com` subdomain. This
subdomain has data replicated from production. SSL (https) is
available on test.seeclickfix.com.


## URL Format

URLs follow the following format

    <%= root_version_url %>/< RESOURCE >

## Data Format

All data is sent and received as JSON.

## Responses

Responses follow one of two patterns: `singular` and `collection`.

`singular` responses return a single items, such as a user ID #145.

`collection` responses return a collection of items. Collection
responses have two guaranteed attributes `metadata` and `result`.
The `metadata` attribute can contain metadata for the consumer about the
result, for example pagination information, api limits, or query
information. Metadata can be null. The `result` attribute contains 
the result of the action.

## Parameters

Many API methods take optional parameters. Optional parameters will be identified as optional in the documentation.

For POST requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded
in the body with a Content-Type of 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
Optionally we accept JSON in the body with a Content-Type of 'application/json':


## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by
default unless otherwise noted. You can specify further pages using the
`?page` parameter. You can also set a custom page size up to 100 with
the `?per_page` parameter. If you'd like to read more than 100 items
you'll need to construct and query the pages programatically.

</pre>


## Blank Fields

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.


## Time Formats

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ


## Error Responses


### Errors

There are two possible types of client errors:

1. Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.

    <%= headers 400 %>

        { "request": "Unable to parse JSON" }


2. Sending invalid fields will result in a `422 Unprocessable Entity`
   response.

    <%= headers 422 %>

        {
              "email": "Can't be blank.",
              "base": "You have not voted on this issue."
        }


### Server Errors

All server errors return `500 Server Error`.

<%= headers 500 %>


## HTTP Redirects

API v2 uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. Clients should assume that any request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is *not* an error and clients should follow that redirect. Redirect responses will have a `Location` header field which contains the URI of the resource to which the client should repeat the requests.

<%= headers 301 %>

The URI you used to make the request has been superseded by the one specified in the `Location` header field. This and all future requests to this resource should be directed to the new URI.

<%= headers 302 %>

The request should be repeated verbatim to the URI specified in the `Location` header field but clients should continue to use the original URI for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with the HTTP 1.1 spec.


## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, API v2 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.


GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources.

PUT
: Used for updating resources.

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.


## User Agent Required

All API requests MUST include a valid User Agent string. Requests with no User Agent
string will be rejected. If you are hitting the API without authentication, we ask that
you add some kind of identification to the UA header value. This is so we can contact
you if there are problems.

## Conditional requests

Most responses return `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers. You can use the values
of these headers to make subsequent requests to those resources using the
`If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers, respectively. If the resource
has not changed, the server will return a `304 Not Modified`.


## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function.  This is typically used when browsers want
to embed SeeClickFix content in web pages by getting around cross domain
issues.  The response includes the same data output as the regular API,
plus the relevant HTTP Header information.


## Geography

At various endpoints SeeClickFix recognizes geography either by a `point` 
or `area` attribute. If multiple points are specified, they will be 
evaulated in the listed order of precedence.

Points can be defined in one of two forms:

1. `lat=:latitude&lng=:longitude` - The latitude and longitude of the point of interest.
1. `address=:address` - Geocode the address and use the resulting latitude/longitude as a point.

`area` attributes can be submitted in the following forms:

1. `lat=:latitude&lng=:longitude&zoom=:zoom`
1. `address=:address&zoom=:zoom`
1. `place_url=:url_name` - See <a href="/v2/places">the places documentation</a> for more information.
1. `min_lat=:sw_lat&min_lng=:sw_lng&max_lat=:ne_lat&max_lng=:ne_lng` - Defines the bounding box of the area of interest.
1. `watcher_token=:watcher_token` - The token can be found in the URL of the watch area's issue map, a link to this can be found on the right hand column of the watch area display page


## Locales

All attributes are consistent between locales. Errors may be translated 
based on the given locale. Objects created will record the locale they 
were created in and notices based on these objects will be delivered with 
the proper locale. i.e. if an issue is created with the "es" locale, all 
email to the creator will be delivered with Spanish translations.
